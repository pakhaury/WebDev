       &emsp;&emsp;Terminal is widely used to run Bash commands and script and it's a important tool to install software dependencies, build program and execute 
       application code. Git is used as source control for code. It is a main tool for developers to collaborate with each other. It maintains version 
       of the code and keeps history of code checked-in by users.

        &emsp;&emsp;VSCode is an important IDE for development of applications. The editor in VCCode makes it easy to develop showing code in 
        different color schemes and makes it easy to format the code. This makes the code easy to read, develop, debug and run.
        The most important feature is in-buit intellisense and auto-complete. HTML is the base of all web development projects to render web pages in browser.
        Javascript is widely used in web development for client side scripting.
